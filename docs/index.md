# Overview

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a justified design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a systemâ€™s architecture and quality.

The purpose of this application is to capture an Architectural Decision and its rationale; display the collection of ADRs created and maintained as a decision log.
